            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 eggs</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon mayonnaise or salad dressing</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon water (Optional)</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon margarine or butter</li>
                    <li>1 pinch salt and pepper to taste</li> 
                </ul>
<br>
            <h4>Steps:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a cup or small bowl, whisk together the eggs, mayonnaise and water using a fork. Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat. Pour in the eggs, and stir constantly as they cook. Remove the eggs to a plate when they are set, but still moist. Do not over cook. Never add salt or pepper until eggs are on plate, but these are also good without. </li>
